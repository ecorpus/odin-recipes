    <h5>This is a mushroom pasta that’s nice and juicy, in no way dry and dull even though it’s not made with a tomato or cream sauce
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g / 7 oz short pasta like orecchiette, penne, macaroni</li>
        <li>400g / 14 oz mushrooms</li>
        <li>50g / 3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese </li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta into the pot when you start cooking the mushrooms.</li><br>
        <li>Cook pasta per packet instructions minus 1 minute. RESERVE 1 mugful of pasta cooking liquid, then drain pasta.</li><br>
        <li>Melt half butter and all oil in a large skillet over heat.
            Add mushrooms and cook until water has leeched then evaporated, and the mushrooms start to turn golden around edges - around 5 minutes.
            Halfway through cooking, add salt & pepper.
            Add garlic and remaining butter, cook for 2 minutes until mushrooms and garlic are golden. </li><br>
        <li>Add pasta, about 3/4 cup of reserved pasta water and parmesan. Toss gently or until water reduces and thickens into a saucy glaze that coats the pasta. If the pasta dries out, add more pasta water.</li><br>
        <li>Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.
            Remove from stove and serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
